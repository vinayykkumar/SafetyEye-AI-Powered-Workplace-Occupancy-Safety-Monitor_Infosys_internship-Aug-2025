## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Enhanced Vehicle Filtering

The system uses multiple aggressive filtering methods to reduce false positives from vehicles and machinery:

1. **Direct Overlap Detection**: IoU-based overlap checking with low threshold
2. **Expanded Zone Filtering**: 40% larger detection zones around vehicles/machinery
3. **Containment Analysis**: Checks if violations are inside super-expanded vehicle areas (60% larger)
4. **Size-based Filtering**: Filters out detections too large to be person-related

### Spatial PPE Association

Advanced spatial heuristics to accurately associate PPE with workers:

- **Hardhat Detection**: Expects detection at top of person box (upper ~45%)
- **Vest Detection**: Looks for detection in middle-lower torso region
- **Mask Detection**: Expects detection around face region (upper ~50%)
- **Fallback IoU**: Uses Intersection over Union when spatial heuristics don't match

### Violation Deduplication

Intelligent deduplication system prevents counting the same violation multiple times:

- Person-based violations tracked per individual
- NO-* detections filtered against existing person violations
- Spatial overlap checking to avoid duplicate alerts
- Confidence-based filtering (threshold: 0.6 for NO-* detections)

### Email Queue System

Thread-safe, non-blocking email processing:

- Background worker thread handles email sending
- Queue-based system prevents UI blocking
- Real-time status tracking (sent/failed counts)
- Recent email logs for debugging
- Automatic worker shutdown on completion

### Report Analytics

Comprehensive analytics included in reports:

- **Risk Assessment**: Calculated risk scores and severity rates
- **Compliance Metrics**: Safety compliance percentages and trends
- **Violation Density**: Violations per worker analysis
- **Temporal Analysis**: First/last violation tracking
- **Hotspot Detection**: Identifies frames with most violations
- **Recommendations**: Automated safety improvement suggestions

## 🛠️ Configuration
